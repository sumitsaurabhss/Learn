    "Learning Rate: This hyperparameter specifies how big the steps are when adjusting the neural network's settings during training. Too big, and you might skip over the best setting; too small, and it'll take a very long time to get there.  \n",

    "Backpropagation: Short for backward propagation of errors. This is like a feedback system that tells each part of the neural network how much it contributed to any mistakes, so it can learn and do better next time.\n",

    "Loss functions: help in improving the accuracy of a model by measuring errors. They quantify the discrepancy between the predicted output and the actual target values. These functions come in different forms to tackle various problems, like deciding between categories (classification) or predicting values (regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross entropy loss: suited for classification task. It's particularly useful when the classes are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean squared error: This shows the average of the squares of the differences between predicted and target values. It's often used for predicting continuous values rather than categories.\n",
