    "# Azure Cosmos DB\n",
    "Azure Cosmos DB supports multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable developers to use the programming semantics of many common kinds of data store to work with data in a Cosmos DB database. Cosmos DB uses indexes and partitioning to provide fast read and write performance and can scale to massive volumes of data. You can enable multi-region writes, adding the Azure regions of your choice to your Cosmos DB account so that globally distributed users can each work with data in their local replica. Cosmos DB automatically allocates space in a container for your partitions, and each partition can grow up to 10 GB in size. Indexes are created and maintained automatically."
