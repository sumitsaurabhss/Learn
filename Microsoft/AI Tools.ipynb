    "### Prompt construction in GitHub Copilot Chat\n",
    "#### Chat participants\n",
    "GitHub Copilot Chat provides better responses when you indicate the scope and intent of your question. You can do this by mentioning chat participants in your chat messages using the `@` symbol. Chat participants are like experts with a specific specialty that can help you with your questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Copilot Chat supports the following built-in chat participants:\n",
    "- `@workspace`: The `@workspace` participant has context about the code in your workspace and can help you navigate it, finding relevant files or classes.\n",
    "- `@vscode`: The `@vscode` participant knows about commands and features in the Visual Studio Code editor itself, and can help you use them.\n",
    "- `@terminal`: The `@terminal` participant has context about the integrated terminal shell and its contents.\n",
    "You can prefix your chat question or prompt with a specific participant to help Copilot generate a more relevant response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slash commands\n",
    "Chat participants can also contribute slash commands, which are shortcuts to specific functionality provided by the chat participant. Slash commands can help clarify intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \"`@workspace /new Node.js Express Pug TypeScript`\" is explicit, concise, and saves you time typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the intent is clear, `@workspace` has a better chance of addressing your needs, despite the inherent ambiguity of natural language. The `@workspace` chat participant can propose a directory structure and users can select the proposed files to preview them. There's a Create Workspace button that generates these files in a new folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of built-in commands:\n",
    "- `/help`: Get help about using GitHub Copilot.\n",
    "- `/doc`: Generate code documentation.\n",
    "- `/clear`: Start a new chat session.\n",
    "- `/explain`: Explain how the selected code works.\n",
    "- `/tests`: Generate unit tests for the selected code.\n",
    "- `/fix`: Propose a fix for the selected code.\n",
    "- `/new`: Scaffold code for a new workspace. Only the chat prompt is used as context.\n",
    "- `/newNotebook`: Create a new Jupyter Notebook. Only the chat prompt is used as context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples using Chat participants combined with slash commands:\n",
    "- `@workspace /explain`: Generate an explanation of the full workspace.\n",
    "- `@workspace /fix` (or `/fix`): Propose a fix for the problems in the selected code.\n",
    "- `@workspace /tests` (or `/tests`): Generate unit tests for the selected code.\n",
    "- `@vscode /api` (or `/api`): Ask about Visual Studio Code extension development.\n",
    "- `@workspace /new` (or `/new`): Scaffold code for a new workspace.\n",
    "- `@workspace /newNotebook` (or `/newNotebook`): Create a new Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chat variables\n",
    "Chat participants, such as `@workspace` or `@vscode`, can contribute chat variables that provide domain-specific context. You can reference a chat variable in your chat prompt by using the `#` symbol. For example, the `#selection` variable contains the text selection in the active editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of built-in chat variables are:\n",
    "- `#editor`: the visible source code in the active editor.\n",
    "- `#selection`: the current selection in the active editor. The editor content is implicitly included in the Chat view context.\n",
    "- `#file`: include a specified file in your workspace as context with your chat prompt.\n",
    "- `#terminalSelection`: the active terminal's selection.\n",
    "- `#terminalLastCommand`: the active terminal's last run command.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If possible, the full contents of the file is included when you use `#file`. If the file is too large to fit into the context window, an outline of the file is included that includes functions and their descriptions without implementations. If the outline is also too large, then the file won't be part of the prompt."
