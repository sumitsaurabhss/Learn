    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have several key parameters that influence how they generate responses. Here are some of the most important ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature: This parameter controls the randomness of the model's output. A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) makes the output more random and creative, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) makes it more focused and deterministic1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Top-P (Nucleus Sampling): This parameter limits the token selection to the most probable options whose cumulative probability meets a specified threshold (e.g., 0.9). It balances diversity and coherence in the generated text1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Max Tokens: This sets the maximum length of the generated response by defining the token limit. It helps control the verbosity of the output1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency Penalty: This reduces the likelihood of repeating words or phrases by penalizing frequently used tokens. It helps avoid repetitive responses1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presence Penalty: This promotes novelty by penalizing tokens that have already appeared in the generated text. It encourages the model to introduce new concepts1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop Sequences: These are specific token patterns that signal the model to stop generating further text. They help in defining clear boundaries for the response1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting these parameters allows you to tailor the model's output to be more predictable or creative, depending on your needs. For example, increasing the temperature can make the responses more imaginative, while using a higher frequency penalty can reduce redundancy"
