    "## Foundation Model\n",
    "A foundation model is a type of AI model that is trained on a vast amount of data at scale, allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks with minimal additional training. These models serve as a base for various applications. They excel at learning from extensive datasets, enabling them to generalize and perform well on tasks they weren't explicitly trained for.\n",
    "- Trained on vast datasets.\n",
    "- Designed to generalize across many tasks, allowing them to perform well on examples they have never seen before.\n",
    "- Require significant computational resources due to their size and complexity.\n",
    "- Examples include models like GPT from OpenAI, Bard from Google, and DALL-E.\n",
