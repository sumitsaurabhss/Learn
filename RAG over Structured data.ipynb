    "To detect and prevent the execution of Data Manipulation Language (DML) queries (such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in a text-to-SQL use case, you can use a combination of techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Parsing and Analysis:  \n",
    "SQL Parsers: Use SQL parsers to analyze the structure of the generated SQL queries. These parsers can help identify the type of SQL statement (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  \n",
    "Regular Expressions: Implement regular expressions to detect DML keywords in the generated SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "DML Triggers:  \n",
    "Database Triggers: Implement DML triggers in your database. These triggers can automatically take action when a DML event occurs, such as logging the event or rolling back the transaction1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Logic:  \n",
    "Whitelist Approach: Maintain a whitelist of allowed SQL operations (e.g., SELECT). Before executing a query, check if it matches the allowed operations.  \n",
    "Blacklist Approach: Maintain a blacklist of disallowed SQL operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Before executing a query, check if it contains any disallowed operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Permissions:  \n",
    "Database Permissions: Configure database user permissions to restrict the execution of DML queries. Ensure that the user account used by the text-to-SQL application has read-only access.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Injection Prevention:  \n",
    "Parameterized Queries: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks, which can be used to execute unauthorized DML queries.\n",
    "By combining these techniques, you can effectively detect and prevent the execution of DML queries in a text-to-SQL use case."
