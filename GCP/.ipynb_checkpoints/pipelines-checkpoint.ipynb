    "- ***ENABLE_CACHING***: (optional) Specifies if this pipeline run uses execution caching. Execution caching reduces costs by skipping pipeline tasks where the output is known for the current set of inputs. If the enable caching argument is not specified, execution caching is used in this pipeline run.\n",

    "- ***LOCATION***: (optional) The region that you want to run the pipeline in. If you don't set this parameter, the default location set in `aiplatform.init` is used.\n",
    "- ***FAILURE_POLICY***: (optional) Specify the failure policy for the entire pipeline. The following configurations are available:\n",
    "  - To configure the pipeline to fail after one task fails, enter `fast`. Tasks that are already scheduled continue running until they are completed.\n",
    "  - To configure the pipeline to continue scheduling tasks after one task fails, enter `slow`. The pipeline continues to run until all tasks have been executed.\n",
    "  If you don't set this parameter, the failure policy configuration is set to `slow`, by default.\n",
